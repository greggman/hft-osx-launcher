hft-osx-launcher
================

The OSX launcher for HappyFunTimes. All it does is open a window and then spawn node process with
output redirected to a window. There are 2 buttons, one the kill the node process and another
to restart it.

This was created because without any kind of GUI there is no way for an end user to see
that the HappyFunTimes server is still running and no easy way to for them to close it
when they are done.
